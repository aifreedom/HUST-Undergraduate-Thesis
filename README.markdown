# Introduction
This is the *unofficial* LaTeX class for Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) undergraduate thesis. The layouts and formats are customized according to [School of Computer Science's requirements to undergraduate thesis](http://www.cs.hust.edu.cn/webroot/showarticle.php?pid=1&cid=7&aid=1172). 

# System Requirements
This LaTeX class is developed with TeX Live 2011 and compiles with XeLaTeX. As I have to deal with many Chinese specific typesetting issues, this class also depends on CTeX.
